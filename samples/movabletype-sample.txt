Feedburner can now add Adsense to your feeds

I was playing with our Feedburner settings today and discovered that they now offer the option of adding Adsense ads to your RSS/Atom feeds. Of course, you need to be approved by the Adsense program first. ProBlogger pointed me to the official announcement.

This is so far the easiest way of adding Adsense to your feeds. You don’t need to figure out where the code needs to go in the XML, it’s all done for you. Feedburner also allows you to configure which feeds will have ads: you can choose to insert ads only on posts that meet a minimum word count, and only to insert ads on all or every 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th post.

I’ve enabled ads on BloggingHelp’s feed. We’ll see in the next few days how effective they are.

Our CTO, <strong>Eric Lunt</strong> is in <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/eric/archives/001284.html">pain</a> (and not in that "hurts so good" kind of way). It seems that many publishers have been hesitant to try FeedBurner's wildly popular services because they are afraid of being locked in without an escape plan. Well, Eric is here to explain the many ways in which FeedBurner allows you - from the risk averse to the daredevil - to <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/eric/archives/001284.html">come and go as you please</a>.

MadBrad Smith of <strong>XS Megazine</strong> Peace,
 http://feeds.feedburner.com/XsMegazine-VideoPodcast

I first want to say I was so happy to find your service when we jumped into the podcasting world on Dec 23rd last year. Thats right, just a month ago. You made it easy for me to get started right away. I was also surprised to find that you are right here in my sweet home Chicago (I live in Evanston now, but was raised on the SOUTH SIDE!!) right downtown.
 
XS Megazines' Video Podcast has gone from no where, to the front page of iTunes podcast section, in new and notable, in under 30 days.
 
So I wanted to send a BIG THANK YOU to the staff and founders of FeedBurner for creating and maintaining this service.
 
Keep it going!!!
 
Peace,
 
MadBrad Smith

"I love FeedBurner!  Not only is the peace of mind invaluable to know that not only is your feed bandwidth being offloaded, but itâ€™s also available even if your site is not available for an upgrade or unforeseen outage.  The other features that were pivotal to me were the easy to remember URL and getting a real time view of my current syndication numbers. "

"I love the feedburner team so much it hurts!  What would we do without them?  I mean everytime I have ever had a problem with them they have been there really fast through the forums, you don't see this kind of care for a FREE product anymore.  I plan to up grade to full stats asap so I can track my fans to a T.  I think the podcasting world has a voice for everyone, and its name is "feedburner".

Blogging has quickly become one of the central pieces of our marketing puzzle and Feedburner has played an instrumental role in the execution of our strategy.  Feedburner?s analytical tools have proven to us that our strategy is working and in marketing, proper analytics are vital to success.  The service was quick and easy to start?in fact, our marketing folks were able to set up the entire Feedburner account without any assistance from engineering.  

We now analyze our Feedburner analytics on a daily basis and our entire company rallies around the results we?re now able to quantify.

Here's a testimonial for you...

I've been running Universe Today (http://www.universetoday.com) for almost 7 years now, and one of the keys to my success and growth has been maintaining a connection with my readers. Traditionally, this has been through a daily email newsletter. I also produce a syndicated version of my stories which are displayed on thousands of other space-related website. And most recently I've added RSS feeds to the site. The problem has always been that enabling and maintaining all these alternative views had been very time consuming. For every hour I spent writing, I had to spend another hour shuffling around content. 

Now with Feedburner, I'm able to republish my feed into all the different forms: RSS, syndicate version, weekly edition, and even send it out as a newsletter with Feedblitz. This has saved me at least an hour of work a day.

And Feedburner does a much better job of publicizing my feed that I was able to do, so traffic to my site is growing nicely too.

Thanks!

I have removed the YPN RSS ads from this blog. Why? Simply because the FeedBurner RSS ads have been performing very well. And since the YPN ads were not contextually relevant, I might as well show the ad that makes more money. :)

Subject: From a new podcaster

Rick:
 
I just listened to your interview on the Chris Pirillo show.  I've been listening to podcasts for the last few weeks and I have been wanting to create my own for a little while.  For some reason I just didn't "get it" until I listened to you and visited feedburner.com.
 
So I just wanted to say thank you for doing what you do and for clearing things up for me as a beginning podcaster.  I'm sure this will be a rewarding experience for me and that's partly due to the great service at Feedburner.
 
Thanks again,
- Jason

I love FeedBurner. My friend and I recently started a podcast and after trying to use stupid third-party software for a while, I came upon FeedBurner. I was astonised at its ease-of-use and nice features. 

Our podcast readership is growing and FeedBurner is making it easy!

comment from problogger post about buzzboost:
I am happy to see all of these services under one roof. I might add that FeedBurner has the single best customer service I have come across when it comes to support, etc. Recently, after a related service (who will remain nameless) refused to even answer my emails (I think 2 weeks is enough, eh?) a really nice guy at FeedBurner offered to contact them for me, and then helped me through the entire process of fixing the problem, in spite of the fact that it was the OTHER vendorâ€™s problem!

Thatâ€™s what I call service, and theyâ€™ve won a devotee in me.

Nice talking to you Steve - forgot to mention that Feedburner 
has the best support on the planet!

J.â€¨----------------------------------------------

I just want to take a few moments to note the excellent service Iâ€™ve received from FeedBurner  over the weekend. My feed for my Vista blog went down over the weekend and initially I thought that it was a FeedBurner issue (it wasnâ€™t - it was a DNS issue to do with the sub domain). Even though the problem wasnâ€™t a FeedBurner related problem and even though it was the weekend, Chris Frye promptly answered my emails and offered suggestions.

Well done FeedBurner!

----------------------------------------------â€¨Fredy Barrios - utzpinpin@gmail.com
Google search: "How to create a podcast", "podcasting", "How does
podcasting work" etc.

Sadly, most of the pages I found were detailed explanations on how to
set up and buy a mic, edit with audacity, and fiddle with xml or html.
In the end, it was like "now that you have your file on an mp3 format,
presto! you are set to podcast, just put it online!! Wait a minute
guys, you have not explained.........

Gee, that was helpful. Specially for us idiots who have absolutely no
knowledge of xml or programming in general.

Your links were more than helpful. You basically said:
Before podcasting, you need
a. a web server or a place on the net to upload and store your mp3s
b  a web page, a blog (aka feed apparently) that has a link to the item above, where the mp3 is stored.
c. we will show you how to do it

This is exactly the place where thousands are getting stuck, and it is
very important to assume nothing, especially that everyone out here is
a geek.

So thankx people, you are actually great teachers and patient enough
to visit us in our poor levels of programming ignorance, but also of
willingness to rise and podcast.

Michael -

Thanks for sending this along. Funny thing, I had already seen your post earlier today. Some people like the copy and others not so much. But I think overall the feedback has been mostly good. I appreciate the shoutout on your site.  We often like to point to blogs that leverage FeedBurner services. Let me know if we can include you among the other folks in Publisher Buzz: http://www.burningdoor.com/buzz/

In the meantime, we'll continue to try to follow the "Marketing that Rocks" mantra and hopefully never make it into your other blog. ;)

Cheers,
Traci

"Without Feedburner, Chub Creek would just be a puddle. Because of them, we have an understanding of who's listening, how many listeners  there are, what the peak listening times are, and what color underwear our audience has on. When iTunes comes out with something new that would normally require a whole bunch of RSS knowledge (which we have none of) Feedburner has already built it in, and it just  works - perfectly. Thanks for making us look so good!" <strong>Dave</strong> from <a href="http://www.chubcreek.com/">Chub Creek</a>. <span class="buzzdate">5/31/06</span>

Not only have you brought sanity to my RSS feeds, by providing them with visual goodness, but you allow me to keep my RSS bandwidth at a minimum, as all readers must meet you first. You take care of all my feeds, and I would not trust them with just anyone! You let me know when my original feed is down, and provide statistics that would otherwise elude even Google Analytics. You'd bring me breakfast in bed, if you weren't so busy minding my xml streams. If you weren't a brilliant piece of software, and I a lowly bio-mass, I would marry you.

Recently described by a journalist for the Sydney Morning Herald as: "way more engaging than when I last saw it ... [with] a superb slogan ... more threads than a Persian rug"

Could you consider my new flying-related feed for your buzz? Here's a blurb you might use:


Some days, author Maria Langer is hard at work at her desk, churning out how-to books and articles for computer users. Other days, she's in the sky, flying a helicopter around Arizona, with or without paying passengers on board. One thing's for sure: whether she's flying into busy Phoenix airspace or landing near remote slot canyons to explore on foot, she'll write about it in her blog. Read about Maria's flying adventures in Maria Langer | Flying.


The feed URL is http://feeds.feedburner.com/marialanger-flying

Keep in mind that this is only one category of my blog. I write about a bunch of other stuff, too.

Thanks for considering this. I get a lot of positive feedback from Web readers -- so I know what I write is appreciated -- but feed readers remains pitifully low. Would love to see more circulation.

Maria

The series - called 'Practical RSS' - was launched on The Digital Edge Blog
(http://www.thedigitaledgeblog.com) last month.  It is currently focusing on
getting people up to speed with using RSS through walkthroughs of real world
examples. Over time, it will embrace more sophisticated users as well.

There are currently two episodes online.  The first episode introduced RSS
and showed how someone could subscribe to and track a feed at
seekingalpha.com using Internet Explorer 7.  The second episode focused on
subscribing to news sites using Google's feed reader.  It also covered how
to create a custom news feed using Google News.

The next show will cover using RSS to track auctions on Ebay, and classified
items on Craigslist.

You can get to it directly at:

I was waiting for the blogger's feed autodiscovery on the feedburner's feed from too long! I think that's a great idea. In my blog you can find some interesting indie review and many many indie mp3 sharing from the label's official web site. Mi m-blog it's about indie and india band, 'cause indie rules! I' give some precious information about how to write on the web, about web writing and about how to write good review.
If you want came on my blog.

>>
>>     It would be fantastic if we could advertise on and track the stats across all our bloggers at some kind of top level (ie. what is the sum of all subscribers of all blogs on our site). Is there a way to do this? Basically something that would entail all referrals from travellerspoint.com or all feeds that include that domain in the url (all our blogs are in the format http://*. travellerspoint.com) are linked to some kind of 'master account' that we have access to.
>>
>>     Based on a suggestion in the feedburner blog we've set up the system to essentially do a http 301 redirect to the feedburner feed, so that our original feed url is not lost in case the member disables the feed at some stage in the future. Is this methodology widely supported by feed readers so that it will work properly for the majority of subscribers? Are the subscribers tracked properly if the feed they are subscribed to redirects through to feedburner?
>>
>>     Last question, and this is slightly off your topic but you might have run across it before. I'm considering making the 301 redirect only redirect through to feedburner if no referrer is passed through, so that someone clicking on the feed logo in Firefox for example would still actually be subscribing to the default location, but the feedreaders would then pull in the feed from feedburner. This is to ensure that those users that subscribe by clicking on that instead of a 'widget' still subscribe to the default location as recommended in that blog post.

It also gives me Metrics on how many people from Morden hit the blog (about 8 visits yesterday alone â€” Hi, England!). And it helps paint a picture for me of what topics are popular and what's not (SCORM 1.2 and ExternalInteface by a wide margin). Google bought FeedBurner.

 I love that I can see where I get most of my readers from and what it
is they were looking for when they found my site. Very cool! Without
feedburner I doubt my blog "India Indeed" would have any reach. Email
subscription has been great, keeps my readers coming back.

Hi Feedburner!

My name is Mandy, and I am a British royal historian. My work is to "Bring You The Best of the British Monarchy" through my website. I have my own video show, blog, and have made a name for myself in the world of the internet. I am not well-known in the wider world, however, and I wish to truly define myself as a famous royal historian and personality one day.

Offline projects of mine include the creation of three stamp covers honoring the Queen, commissioned by a British philatelic museum; lectures on the history of the monarchy, and I am passionate about British-American cultural ties. Would it be possible to move to television and radio? I certainly hope so!

Thanks for listening to my buzz!

Best,


Mandy

Hi,

Just wanted to say a quick, "Thank you" for helping me use a great tool to get the word out about a site for agile software developers (located at www.implementingscrum.com).  Started just over one year ago, I have seen steady traffic increases and people come back each week for a new cartoon about an agile technique called, "Scrum."  Funny word.  Even funnier cartoons!  Also, the site has been translated in over ten languages to date and sees traffic growing from around the world each day.  Thank you FeedBurner for helping me with the tools to help spread the word about this award-winning and insightful site!

Thank you,

Muse is not your average design gallery. It reveals the person behind the art, and their inspiration for creation. Muse opened its URL to the public in August 2007. Since then it has grown to be a source of inspiration for all kinds of designers. My reason for developing Muse was to create a gallery where the focus is on the Artist, rather than simply the Art. I have often wondered what inspires great artisits/creators, and that is where Muse came from. Muse will not only showcase great art, but it will also attempt to showcase the inspiration behind the art. And ultimaely the inspiration of great artists/creators.  Get inspired now, subscribe to the feed (link here: feed://feeds.feedburner.com/MuseShowcases).


Thanks for your awesome service Feedburner!  I love it!!

Jeff Caylor's album "Okay" was recently named the #5 CD of 2007 by ChristianityToday.com. This is especially remarkable considering the album's production and marketing budget was less than $3,000, including replication. Relying on a dynamic web presence and lots of word of mouth, the CD appears on the list alongside industry stalwarts like Switchfoot and Relient K. <a href="http://jeffcaylor.com/">JeffCaylor.com</a> has proudly used <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Jeffcaylorcom">FeedBurner feeds</a> since 2006. <span class="buzzdate"> 2/14/08</span>

"Hi, my name is Jack" is a brand new blog based on the book of the same name.  Jack is an alcoholic, and has an incredible story to tell.  Jack's life is like something out of a really long twisted TV mini-series about dysfunction in the family, at the root of which is alcoholism.  Unfortunately, it's all true.  Through it all is a message of hope for anyone affected directly or indirectly by alcoholism.  The worst can happen, and yet there is still hope.

Dear Feedburner,

Here is my buzz as one of your publishers, I would greatly appreciate if you would consider running it! I think many users would be interested:

"As a 22 year-old, I run a blog for parents to understand their kids from the perspective of actual teens.  I post articles, videos, screencasts and hosts live chats to offer parents a window into the daily lives of their net-generation teen and tween kids. I show parents how to talk with their screen-obsessed, tech-savvy children about everything: including safely using Facebook, smoking pot, High School dances, sex, and give them tips from actual teens. Thank goodness for feedburner--it keeps me going!"--On Teens Today with Vanessa Van Petten

Thank you for considering my buzz!

We Hit & Run consists of the two most compatible voices in radio, Kevin Scampoli and Anthony Saunders. We have earned the moniker: "The Best Podcast Alive", and we recently signed a deal with KLAV 1230am: The Talk Of Las Vegas.

It all started with twelve Feedburner subscribers, and we owe any and all success to this wonderful service!

Hi Buzz -

I wanted to tell you how we're using FeedBurner at our small, liberal arts college in Pennsylvania, Allegheny College.

I've been using FeedBurner for years to deliver all sorts of RSS content on our site, www.allegheny.edu. We use FeedBurner to power our news and events feeds, our student ride board, job openings, Athletics news, our intranet news and much more. 

What I really dig is the email subscription abilities. This has made distributing information, especially to our on-campus audiences, very very easy. We no longer have to create special email newsletters rehashing the day's news - now our workload has been reduced and FeedBurner does the work for us. 

Bravo!

Thanks,
Mike

Hello Feedburner!

Walt Sherman here,  I was checking out your site and i wanted to update you on a seriously growing movement in Philadelphia against the loud, obnoxious Duck boats that drive around this city.  The campaign is called Shut the Duck UP! and it has been gaining a lot of attention since October when I started it.  Shut the Duck UP! has a blog(found www.shuttheduckup.blogspot.com) which is regularly updated, and talks about the many protests I've done to battle against the ducks.  We have an online petition that is gaining signatures, and we are planning to stage a huge protest in the Spring.  We've been featured in a lot of recent press, including articles from Phillyist, Slog, Philadelphia WillDo, and Philadelphia University will be featuring us in an upcoming article.  I think this is the perfect quirky news story for you to feature on your buzz!  Thank you!

Sincerely,
Walt Sherma

Hey Feedburner!

 

I'm a Broadway and Off-Broadway theater producer in New York with three shows currently running:  Altar Boyz, The Awesome 80s Prom and My First Time.  I am a recent Crain's Magazine "40 Under 40" and I was also featured in an iPhone commercial talking about my show, My First Time.

 

My blog is the only blog written by a commercial theater producer in New York City and features discussions on everything from new forms of marketing entertainment to ways to reduce the risk of producing on and off-Broadway as well as how to beat writer's block and what are the shows to see. 

 

I believe in "open-book" (or open blog) producing.  If more people, authors, actors, designers, understand WHY we have to make certain decisions, perhaps we can change our very restrictive model so that more theater can be produced.  And they'll only understand why if they hear it directly from us! shows to see.

Wateroos is an awesome idea. They are taking the idea of bottled water to the children's market. But do they have the right stuff inside the juice-like boxes to be a hit? http://blog.bundlo.com/2008/03/03/review-wateroos/

adventures in learning the practice of mediation

Chronicling the learning experiences of a newly trained mediator. I'm seeking experience wherever I can find it, and learning quite a lot as I put my new skills into practice.

I want this blog can serve as a different resource for the mediation community than the many seasoned professionals' blogs out there, especially burgeoning mediators like myself.

So come join me in learning about mindfulness, mediation, communication, conflict management and conflict resolution.

Hi Feedburner Gurus!

Yesterday, my blog celebrated its 1-year birthday. Yup, it's been a year
already -- I can't believe it! Since some of the readers hail from
places as remote as Jakarta, London, Belgium and Paris, we partied via
the interwebtubes online, and the party's still raging this morning.
Feedburner made it easy to keep folks in the loop with details on the
festivities, so thanks so much, you guys!

Keep up the good work, Feedburner-ettes. Drop by the party if you get a
chance.

Your friendly neighborhood beauty addict,

Karen

Our Feed: http://feeds.feedburner.com/ArabianMonkey
Our Website: http://www.arabianmonkey.com
 
Arabianmonkey.com was founded in the summer of 2007 in Davison, Michigan by two twenty-something college students looking for a way to promote their writing. They chose "The Gerk" and "The Douginator" as pseudonyms and began to construct what would eventually become the Arabianmonkey.com. Dozens of articles and hundreds of thousands of hits later, Arabianmonkey.com has grown into a success story. Completely original, mostly humorous, articles make up the core of the site while the rest consists of a forum, a games section, a store, a page devoted to making money online, and a poker blog detailing The Gerk's internet poker career. (Which also happens to use FeedBurner)

Duct Tape Marketing is a long time Feedburner fan and we just
published a 3-part series called Fun with RSS. Each post features
a video showing practical ways to use RSS technology in business.

All three posts feature Feedburner as part of the puzzle.

Thought you might want to point the tutorials out.

I've been using FeedBurner for over a year, which seems like a long
time given how many things have happened in my life since then. I
started blogging at Blogger, but promoted the FeedBurner feed on my
blog, knowing that I might want to switch to another platform sooner
or later. When I did switch to WordPress, I simply edited my feed
details and the transition was seamless for those subscribers using my
FB feed.

When I wanted to change feed names, I didn't want to lose my existing
subscribers and wondered how to do it on my blog. Rick Klau came to my
rescue and told me how to use FB's feed redirection to ensure that
everyone would be forward to my new feed. I've used that feature
several times since then.

What I think is really cool is that I was one of the (relatively)
early users of FeedBurner, and got to choose whatever feed names I
wanted. I ended up with two of the coolest feed URLs out there,
feeds.feedburner.com/Images and feeds.feedburner.com/Information.
Aren't they awesome?

I've been using Feed Flares ever since they got introduced, and I love
them. A few of my feeds are also in FAN, and those ad revenues are
offsetting my hosting and domain fees. Buzz Boost and Headline
Animator are two other useful feature for me. I use them to promote my
content on my other personal sites or in my public profile at sites
like Flickr.

I also created my own feed network where I spliced the feeds for the
various online content I create into a single uni-feed:
feeds.feedburner.com/Raoul. The only thing I wish for with the FB
Networks is that I'd like to be able to add feeds not listed in FAN,
and that's not currently possible.

Email subscriptions are an incredibly useful feature that I don't know
what I'd do without. The fact that FeedBurner manages it so well and
makes it so easy is a huge draw for me. While I don't have a lot of
subscribers via email, those using that feature wouldn't use RSS, so
I'm really glad they've got a "Web 1.0" option of keeping up to date
with my content.

I used the PRO features long before they got to be free, and I was
glad to pay for them. I was getting (and still am) stat figures I
can't get anywhere else.

FeedBurner's been an amazing resource for me, and has helped me manage
and understand my content distribution in ways that are now part and
parcel of my online strategy. I log onto FB several times a day to
check my stats, particularly the Item Use stats. What can I say, I'm
addicted! :-)
